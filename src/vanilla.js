        Vanilla

        A basic JavaScript Library that will mimic some jQuery funcitonality
        and allow us to explore some of the ways that jQuery achieves things
        as well as illustrating places where we really might not need jQuery
        to perform certain actions.

    //this will be the basis of our library, much like jQuery's `jQuery` function (often aliased as `$`)
    var $v = function(selector) {
        //if this constructor was called without the `new` keyword, we should do that
        if(this === window) {
            return new $v(selector);
        }

        //instead of a complicated selector engine like Sizzle, we'll just be relying on `document.querySelectorAll()`
        //we are using `[].slice.call()` to turn the Array-like list of HTML Nodes into an actual array that we can use native Array methods on
        this.elements = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(selector));

        //return our object so that we can chain methods from our prototype
        return this;
    };

    //set up our prototype and alias it is `$v.fn` much like jQuery has `jQuery.fn` (often aliased as `$.fn`)
    $v.fn = $v.prototype = {};
